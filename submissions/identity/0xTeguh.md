# Project: IDSafe – Your Personal Digital Identity

## Summary
IDSafe is my attempt to make managing digital identities simpler and safer. Instead of relying on large centralized services, users maintain full control over their own data. Using Soundness, every action—such as creating or updating an identity—is verifiable without compromising privacy.

## Why This Matters
Managing identity online is complex and often insecure. IDSafe provides users with a personal vault they fully own, where nothing happens without their consent. The goal is to make identity **portable, private, and secure**, while demonstrating how **Soundness proofs** can be applied in real-world scenarios.

## Features
- **Full control of your identity**—only the user decides who sees what.  
- **Verifiable claims**: third parties can check proofs without accessing raw data.  
- **Timestamped actions** on the Soundness layer.  
- **Modular integration** with apps in gaming, social networks, or finance.  

## How It Works
- **Tech stack:** Node.js backend, simple Solidity smart contracts, and Soundness CLI for proofs.  
- **Data security:** All sensitive data is encrypted before leaving the device.  
- **Proofs:** Identity claims are verifiable through Soundness’ provable layer.  
- **Modular approach:** The vault can easily plug into other applications.  

## Current Status
- Local prototype is functional.  
- Core identity creation and verification logic implemented.  
- Next steps: improved UI, NFT-based identity badges, multi-chain support.  

## Submission Notes
Submitting this under `identity` to get feedback and eventually join the **Soundness Dev playground**. Excited to collaborate and explore how we can build on top of Soundness!
